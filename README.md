#### Branches:

- feat/cart-react-context:
  This branch was initially constructed. However, upon completing the project using this approach, I encountered a performance issue. Consequently, I opted to change my approach for handling the app's shopping cart state.

- feat/cart-redux
  After identifying a performance issue when using React's 'context API,' I made the decision to implement 'Redux' for managing the shopping cart state of the app. This branch includes the app with this feature successfully integrated.
